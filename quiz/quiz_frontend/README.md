Quiz.js is a full CRUD, Single Page Application built with React, Ruby, Rails,
SQL, and Postgres. It is a collaboration project between Anand Patel, Andrew
Bayles, and Ben Pitts. The user is prompted to answer questions that can help
solidify their understanding of JavaScript fundamentals. The team used Rails to
map routes, and query/return JSON objects from the database. Using React, the
question is dynamically rendered to the page and the user is able to input a multiple
choice answer. A program was written to compare the user input to the stored
answer in the data. If the answer matches, a 'correct' statement is rendered to
the page, a point value accumulates, and the next question is generated. Users also
have the ability to create, update, and delete questions from the database and the
app if fully responsive and mobile friendly! <br>
